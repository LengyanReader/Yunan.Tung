## 【A Flag】A Project on Mathematcal View of Data Science(2022-04-29)

As a mathematical man and dataman, I have some experieneces, trainings and abilities in both academic study and work practice. In the area of data science, many wonderful applications have impacted the world so much, and in recent years, there arise some problems due to lacking sufficient support in theory. Any authentic successuful work is built on the combination of theory and practice. For data science, an pillar is, no doubt, mathematics, and in fact, most needed theories are just there, it needs time to arrange and good presentation for understanding.

Inspired by serveral wonderful new and classical books, like **_Mathematical Pictures at a Data Science Exhibition_**, **_Topological Data Analysis for Genomics and Evolution: Topology in Biology_**, **_Computational Topology for Data Analysis_**, **_Probabilistic Machine Learning: Advanced Topics_**, to name a few. I will be proceeding a project to provide a concise combination of mathematics, prototype coding and computational tips on important topics in the area of data science. It is an attempt to get a balance between theory and practice in depth and width. I have prepared it years,  and sincerely wish more friends could come to contribute.

Kevin P. Murphy's **_Probabilistic Machine Learning: Advanced Topics_** provides a concise summary on PML-model's use: **Prediction, Generation,Discovery, Decision Making**.
