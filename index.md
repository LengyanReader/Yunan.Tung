## Road and Roads(2022-08-11)

Walking in the morning, the breeze of late summer is cool and refreshing like always. Tao Te Ching（道德经）is really the classical book worth reading always, [https://www.unl.edu/prodmgr/NRT/Tao%20Te%20Ching%20-%20trans.%20by%20J.H..%20McDonald.pdf](https://www.unl.edu/prodmgr/NRT/Tao%20Te%20Ching%20-%20trans.%20by%20J.H..%20McDonald.pdf)

## I am Looking for Ph.D. Positions: A Nerd Thinking What is Right in Learning (2022-07-26)

I am not an quite excellent person but try to do the right thing,  with a humble and active mindset and proper courage, especially when in a non-ideal condition. The master’s program I just finished, existed lots of issues in course quality. Almost all the courses by themselves are indeed worth learning, but actually, the teaching of theory didn’t touch the cores of principle and the practice of the courses was far from real applications, and examinations were full of rote memorization, which is from my own feeling, with my criticism but no complaint. Only following the routine of the master’s program can’t make essential progress for me. So, based on the courses provided, I have to put most of my focus on learning the mathematical foundations(especially in algebra, geometry, and topology) of machine learning, calmly, earnestly, and patiently, for this reason, I’ve formed a kind of essential and systematic understanding of machine learning and the like as well as the increasing research competence and passion(the price is bad study results), and this is just the most important achievement that is formless for me during the two years. The study of machine learning mathematics is worth doing,  naturally, I am willing to find a job like this.

After I got my bachelor's degree in applied mathematics and statistics, I worked in the application of data science for nearly 10 years, having experienced quite a few machine learning projects of success or failure. Although there seem countless details in the operational level of these models or algorithms, in logic and mathematics, they can be reduced into some implicit assumptions, simple components, explicit rules, and relations. This always inspires me to think, search, and explore how to use underlying methods to fundamentally leverage model performance in inference, analytics, interpretability, and explainability at its best. There should be three important directions:
1. )Building domain knowledge base
2. )Constructing expressive features
3. )Optimizing model structures

For 1), it is to make generalizations and summaries on needed background knowledge and build proper knowledge structures, and for 2) it is used to construct proper modes of extracting sufficiently useful information from data. Moreover, for 1) and 2), the relevant work of constructing knowledge or feature structures is essentially regarding information encoding. In theory, encoding information through mathematical invariance(e.g., in algebra or topology) is an elegant way to encode critical information as much as possible with the least assumptions, which is mainly involved in TAG(topology,  algebra, and geometry), for instance, algebraic topology. For 3), an interesting topic is how to efficiently propagate useful information during the running process of the models used, especially in the path of deep neuro network, which may be related to various differential equations. Just to name a few.  No doubt, these are all transformed into mathematical problems, which is just and always my major and profession, naturally, I am willing to go further in it.  

As a nerd, trying to stress on some authentic spirit, I am looking forword to meeting good friends to supervise me.

## A Simple Graduation and A Concise Retrospect of the Recent 10 years (2022-07-14)

I’ve finished my master's project in the program of statistics and machine learning, at Linkoping University (in Sweden) and received my diploma. To be honest, it is not worth a mention, since there are many more significant and valuable things in the real world in the age of change.

There is one kind of meaningful working style, that is to utilize proper methods with broad perspectives to study the phenomena or solve the problems around us in daily life and to make the public really feel some reference significance or actual improvements for their lives.  When dealing with concrete topics in real life, based on the accumulated information from domain knowledge, inspired by vivid and intuitive human behaviors, empowered by the combined methods in mathematics, computation, and engineering, there will never lack valuable achievements. 

I’ve worked in data science for nearly 10 years, and I am not a young man's age already.   However, surprising to me, I’ve not become bored with mathematics and engineering, but with increasing curiosity and ability, and I work hard to use these methods to study and solve the problems in daily life.  Furthermore, through experiencing many cases of inappropriate course design and teaching, which caused many troubles in learning, I’ve felt an impulse to become a teacher good at teaching and helping students in learning, and I believe good teaching and good research can benefit each other if seeing the two as one.  More importantly, I hope to do something to make research work and practical work more compatible and reciprocal.  In the age of change, many old structures need to be adjusted and integrated into new ways, and I tend to rhythmically explore and study new methods based on the reasonable cores of old ones.   

My undergraduate major is in mathematics and statistics (2006-2010). Since the university I was in has a good atmosphere for the study of media and communication, both my interdisciplinary perspective and interest in the combination of quantitative and qualitative methods to study phenomena were formed then. When working as a data man(2011-2020), I extensively learned and applied various modeling methods to deal with the problems of information propagation, such as public opinion analysis, online advertising, and interactive marketing, there involve lots of analysis and experiments on users behavior and mentality, from which I uncovered quite a few business insights and I’ve also become a data scientist competent in discovery, visualization, analysis, modeling, programming, and decision making in terms of providing practical solutions on concrete problems. In the recent master’s program (2020.8-2022.8), based on the courses provided, I did sufficient investigations on the logical and mathematical foundations and the applications of important modeling methods in data science, and once again I’ve rebuilt my knowledge system in a better level. In fact, the progress of lifetime learning never stops, and it has become part of me.

In the just finished master's program, I was not the student only following routines but spending much more time focusing on the more important and interesting things based on but going beyond what had been taught, so I didn’t spend so much time preparing for examinations.  Please don’t think I have no good ability or attitude in learning and studying.  I want to defend using some words:  by spending the time learning the fundamental theories of mathematics, statistics, and data science as well as the corresponding promising applications, and actually, I have attained many more profound and penetrating understandings and skills in nearly all the courses provided, and these should be what is really needed in real teaching, research work and practice; compared with making authentic progress, I chose to not focus on improving grades.  So, life is colorful and complex, isn’t it?      

Through the learning, thinking, and practice of these years,  apart from having some professional scientific and technological skills(e.g., I am skilled in logical analysis, experiment design, mathematical modeling, programming, teasing out literature, and so forth), I’ve gradually become good at balancing different factors, coordinating various relations, and allocating all kinds of possible resources in order to achieve a good work effect in an efficient and meaningful way. Many data science works are easy to start, but may not be quite easy to generate insightful conclusions for interpretation or workable suggestions for practice. I know the challenges ahead, such as work pressures, systematic issues, and a variety of uncertainties, but these are unlikely to be more difficult to be solved than the other problems in real life, and I’ve been well prepared for that. I have a simple and effective belief: when proceeding with a task, once every step is done in a wise way, even if the original objective may not be completely obtained due to some uncontrollable reasons, an equally valuable result can still be attained at least.


## 【A Flag】A Project on Mathematcal View of Data Science(2022-04-29)

As a mathematical man and dataman, I have some experieneces, trainings and abilities in both academic study and work practice. In the area of data science, many wonderful applications have impacted the world so much, and in recent years, there arise some problems due to lacking sufficient support in theory. Any authentic successuful work is built on the combination of theory and practice. For data science, a pillar is, no doubt, mathematics, and in fact, most needed theories are just there, it needs time to arrange and good presentations for understanding.

Inspired by serveral wonderful new and classical books, like **_Mathematical Pictures at a Data Science Exhibition_**, **_Topological Data Analysis for Genomics and Evolution: Topology in Biology_**, **_Computational Topology for Data Analysis_**, **_Probabilistic Machine Learning: Advanced Topics_**, to name a few. I will be proceeding a project to provide a concise combination of mathematics, prototype coding and computational tips on important topics in the area of data science. It is an attempt to get a balance between theory and practice in depth and width. I have prepared it years,  and sincerely wish more friends could come to contribute.
